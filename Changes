1.03	Thu Oct 26 10:14:20 2000

	- Tweaked test.pl and POD

	- required 5.005
	  (module uses funky stuff that's broken in earlier perls - sorry Dave)

	  if it's installed.

	- Changed semantics of footer generation slightly (see doc)

	- fixed niggle in widow handling under full justification

	  (thanks Chaim)

        - Added separator handling to autoformat -- also fixes
          underlining of heading (thanks very much Simon)


1.04	Tue Dec  5 10:31:22 2000

	- Limited numerical bullets to 3 digits.
	  This stops autoformat from misclassifying orphaned years such as
	  2001.

	- Doc patch on numerical formatting (thanks Andy)

	- Major bug fixes to renumbering mechanism

	- Turned off renumbering in quoted text.

	  (Thanks Rick)
