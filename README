                 Release of version 1.03 of Text::Autoformat
==============================================================================


NAME
    Text::Autoformat - Automatic and manual text wrapping and reformating

DESCRIPTION

    Text::Autoformat provides intelligent formatting of
    plaintext without the need for any kind of embedded mark-up. The module
    recognizes Internet quoting conventions, a wide range of bulleting and
    number schemes, centred text, and block quotations, and reformats each
    appropriately. Other options allow the user to adjust inter-word
    and inter-paragraph spacing, justify text, and impose various
    capitalization schemes. 

    The module also supplies a re-entrant, highly configurable replacement
    for the built-in Perl format() mechanism.
