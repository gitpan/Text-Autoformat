                 Release of version 1.12 of Text::Autoformat
==============================================================================


NAME
    Text::Autoformat - Automatic and manual text wrapping and reformating

DESCRIPTION

    Text::Autoformat provides intelligent formatting of
    plaintext without the need for any kind of embedded mark-up. The module
    recognizes Internet quoting conventions, a wide range of bulleting and
    number schemes, centred text, and block quotations, and reformats each
    appropriately. Other options allow the user to adjust inter-word
    and inter-paragraph spacing, justify text, and impose various
    capitalization schemes. 

    The module also supplies a re-entrant, highly configurable replacement
    for the built-in Perl format() mechanism.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.12


	- Now honours -- mail sig introducer
	  (stops formatting that that point)

	- Now ignores mail headers

	- Added exportable &ignore_headers for 
	  when using in user-defined "ignore" subs

	- Now handles of embedded HTML entities 
	  (thanks David)

	- Added call to C<use utf8> for 5.6 compatibility
	  (thanks Paolo)

	- Restricted normal numbering to the range 0-999
	  to prevent false numbering caused by a year (like
	  1999) at the start of a line (like this)

	- Fixed subtle bug with words starting with "ps-"
	  being treated as post scripts (thanks Rashid!)
